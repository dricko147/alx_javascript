    Understand the Document Object Model (DOM)
    Access and Manipulate Elements with JavaScript
    How to use CSS selectors and traverse the DOM tree
    How to work with event listeners/handlers

Brief Introduction
What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?

The Document Object Model, often referred to as the DOM, is a crucial concept in web development. It forms the bridge between web pages and the JavaScript language, enabling you to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage in real-time. Understanding the DOM is like gaining the keys to the inner workings of a website.
Access and Manipulate Elements with JavaScript

One of the core skills that you need to develop as a web developer is the ability to access and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript. Whether it’s changing the text within a paragraph, updating an image, or altering the style of an element, you’ll need to gain the power to make dynamic changes to web pages.
Using CSS Selectors and Traversing the DOM Tree

You should also master the art of using CSS selectors to pinpoint specific HTML elements within a page. Understanding how to traverse the DOM tree will enable you to navigate between elements, their parents, and their children with ease. With knowledge of this, you will be able to target the right element for modification or interaction.
Working with Event Listeners/Handlers

No interactive web application is complete without event handling. You’ll need to learn how to capture user interactions, such as clicks and keystrokes, and respond to them using event listeners and handlers. This skill will open doors to building engaging and responsive web experiences.

Tasks
0. Play with the DOM
mandatory

Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the basic concept of the DOM by accessing and modifying an HTML element.

Use the HTML code below as the starting point and add your JavaScript code as an internal <script> tag:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>DOM Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="myParagraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

    Write JavaScript code to select the element using its id and store it in a variable
    Use the DOM API to modify the content of the <p> element to I successfully updated this paragraph with javascript
    Make use of document.getElementById
    Verify that the program successfully modifies the element content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: dom_manipulation
    File: 0-select-id.html

1. Selecting HTML Elements Using Selectors
mandatory

Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of selectors to select specific HTML elements.

Use the HTML code below as the starting point and add your JavaScript code as an internal <script> tag:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Selecting Elements</title>
  <style>
    .highlight {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

    Use the DOM API to modify the format of the <p class="highlight"> element to make the content boldened
    Make use of document.querySelectorAll
    Verify that the program successfully modifies the element content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: dom_manipulation
    File: 1-select-class.html

2. Modifying Element Content, Attributes, and Styles
mandatory

Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of selectors to select specific HTML elements.

Use the HTML code below as the starting point and add your JavaScript code as an internal <script> tag:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modifying Elements</title>
  <style>
    img {
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <img id="myImage" src="https://picsum.photos/200/300" alt="My Image">
</body>
</html>

    Write JavaScript code to select the <img> element using its id and store it in a variable.
    Use the DOM API to modify the following:
        the src to https://picsum.photos/200/301,
        the alt to New image
        the border style to 2px solid red
    Make use of document.getElementById
    Verify that the program successfully modifies the element content when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: dom_manipulation
    File: 2-select-image.html

3. Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements
mandatory

Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the creation, appending, and removal of elements using the DOM.

Use the HTML code below as the starting point and add your JavaScript code as an internal <script> tag:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Creating and Removing Elements</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="container"></div>
</body>
</html>

    Write JavaScript code to select the container element using its id and store it in a variable.
    Use the DOM API to create a new <p> element, and add New paragraph as its content
    Append the newly created elements to the container element.
    Add a button that removes/hides the newly created paragraph when first click and shows it when clicked again
    Verify that the program successfully creates, appends, and toggles elements when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: dom_manipulation
    File: 3-multiple-actions.html
