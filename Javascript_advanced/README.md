Tasks
0. Lexical scoping and welcome message
mandatory

Create a function named welcome:

    It takes two arguments: firstName (string) and lastName (string)
    It contains a variable named fullName, that will contains the firstName followed by a space and then the lastName
    Within the welcome function, write a function named displayFullName:
        It should display an alert with the message Welcome followed by a space, then the variable fullName followed by an exclamation mark.
    Call the function displayFullName at the end of the function welcome

How to test

    Open your web inspector in the tab “Console”
    Copy paste your code in the console and hit enter
    Copy and paste this welcome('Holberton', 'School'); and hhit enter to run that code. It should prompt an alert with this content: Welcome Holberton School!
    When you write and execute alert(fullName) afterwards, it should return a reference error fullName is not defined

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Javascript_advanced
    File: 0-welcome.js

1. Closure Scope Chain
mandatory

    Create a variable named globalVariable with value Welcome
    Create a function outer that:
        alerts the content of the variable globalVariable
        creates a variable named course with value Holberton
        creates a function inner that:
            alerts the content of the variable globalVariable and course (concatenated)
            creates a variable named exclamation with value !
            creates a function inception that alerts the content of the variable globalVariable, course, and exclamation (concatenated)
            calls the function inception
        calls the function inner
    Call the function outer

Compose the code:

    Write the function inception within inner
    Write the function inner within outer
    Call the function outer in the main code (outside any function)
    Call the function inner within outer
    Call the function inception within inner

Requirements:

    Running the script should display three popups one by one with the text Welcome, Welcome Holberton, and Welcome Holberton!

2. Closure
mandatory

Write a function named welcomeMessage:

    It accepts one argument fullName (string)
    It should be a closure for an alert displaying Welcome <fullName>

After this function definition, create three variables:

    guillaume contains a call welcomeMessage with Guillaume as argument
    alex contains a call welcomeMessage with Alex as argument
    fred contains a call welcomeMessage with Fred as argument

How to test:

    In your web console, cop/paste your file
    Executing the following in the console:

guillaume();
alex();
fred();

Should display three alerts like below:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Javascript_advanced
    File: 2-function_me.js

3. Closure and loops
mandatory

Write a function named createClassRoom:

    It takes into argument numbersOfStudents (number)
    Inside, it contains a function studentSeat, that takes into argument seat (number) and returns a function that returns the seat number
    After the definition of studentSeat, create and populate a variable students (array)
        Using a loop from 0 to numbersOfStudents, pass the number of iteration + 1 to studentSeat and add its return value to the students array
    Returns the students array

Create a closure classRoom, calling createClassRoom with 10 students

Requirements:

Executing the following code:

console.log(classRoom[0]());
console.log(classRoom[3]());
console.log(classRoom[9]());

Should return

1
4
10

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Javascript_advanced
    File: 3-classrooms.js

0/12 pts
4. Complex Closure
mandatory

Create a function divideBy:

    It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
    It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
        It returns the second number divided by the first number

Create a function addBy:

    It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
    It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
        It returns the sum of the two numbers

Create four closures:

    addBy100, that uses the function addBy with the number 100
    addBy1000, that uses the function addBy with the number 1000
    divideBy10, that uses the function divideBy with the number 10
    divideBy100, that uses the function divideBy with the number 100

Requirements:

Executing the following code:

console.log(addBy100(20));
console.log(divideBy10(20));
console.log(divideBy100(200));
console.log(addBy1000(20));

Should display in the console:

120
2
2
1020

5. Changing DOM with closure
mandatory

Create a function named changeMode:

    It accepts 5 arguments size (number), weight (string), transform (string), background (string), color (string)
    Using closure, it changes the style of the entire page and set the font-size, font-weight, text-transform, background-color, and color

Write a function named main:

    Set a variable named spooky that passes the arguments 9, bold, uppercase, pink, green to changeMode
    Set a variable named darkMode that passes the arguments 12, bold, capitalize, black, white to changeMode
    Set a variable named screamMode that passes the arguments 12, normal, lowercase, white, black to changeMode
    Add a paragraph to the body of the page with the text Welcome Holberton!
    Add a button to the body with the text Spooky
    Add a button to the body with the text Dark mode
    Add a button to the body with the text Scream mode
    When clicking on each button, the page CSS should change to the different themes you created previously

Call the main function

Requirements:

    Use vanilla javascript to add the elements to the DOM and change the style of the page
    JQuery not allowed!

Clicking the Spooky button should change the web page to look something like this:

Clicking the Dark mode button should change the web page to look something like this:

Clicking the Scream mode button should change the web page to look something like this:

6. Private methods with closure
mandatory

Write a module named studentHogwarts:

    It contains two variables privateScore set to 0, and name set to null
    It contains one private method changeScoreBy, it takes points in argument and add it to privateScore
    The module gives access to four public methods (return an object):
        setName, it takes into argument newName, and set the private variable name
        rewardStudent, it calls the method changeScoreBy with 1
        penalizeStudent, it calls the method changeScoreBy with -1
        getScore, it returns name: score (ex: Harry: 14)

Create one variable named harry, that is an instance of studentHogwarts:

    Set the name of the object to Harry
    Reward the student four times
    Log to the console the name and score

Create one variable named draco, that is an instance of studentHogwarts:

    Sets the name of the object to Draco
    Reward the student one time
    Penalize the student three times
    Log to the console the name and score

Requirements:

    Executing the code should display in the console

Harry: 4
Draco: -2

7. Stack order and setTimeout
mandatory

Write the following commands in the following order:

    Log to the console Start of the execution queue
    Log to the console Final code block to be executed using setTimeout (with delay of 0)
    Using a loop that iterates 100 times, each iteration logs to the console the iteration number
    Log to the console End of the loop printing

Requirements:

    Your code should log to the console the following:

Start of the execution queue
