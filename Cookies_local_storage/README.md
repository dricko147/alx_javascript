5. Local storage
mandatory

Let’s build a basic shopping cart in a new file. Setup your files with the following:

    Create an array availableItems that will contain all the available items. Add the strings Shampoo, Soap, Sponge, and Water in the array
    If Local storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one
    If local storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function createStore and displayCart

Create a function addItemToCart:

    It takes on argument item (string)
    It adds a key to the local storage of the name of the item, and set the value to true

Create a function createStore:

    Create a ul and append it to the DOM
    Loop through the array of items, and create a list item to add to the ul
    The item should display the name of the available product
    On click the item should call the function addItemToCart

Create a function displayCart:

    If the local storage does not contain any item, this function does not do anything
    If the local storage contains any item, it should display the message You previously had X items in your cart in a p element that you can append to the body

Tips:

    At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items
    If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart
    If you open a new tab, you should also see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart

Requirements:

    Build the DOM using Javascript only
    You must use the local storage of your browser and not a cookie or session storage
    Access your code with http://localhost:8080/5-index.html
    Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Cookies_local_storage
    File: 5-index.html

6. Session storage
mandatory

Reusing the code from the previous task, replace the use of local storage by session storage

Tips:

    At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items
    If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart
    If you open a new tab, you should not see any message

Requirements:

    Build the DOM using Javascript only
    You must use the session storage of your browser and not a cookie or local storage
    Access your code with http://localhost:8080/6-index.html
    Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Cookies_local_storage
    File: 6-index.html

7. Advanced use of web storage
mandatory

In a new file, let’s build a more advanced cart system using Session Storage. Setup your files with the following:

    Create an array availableItems that will contain all the available items. Add the strings Shampoo, Soap, Sponge, and Water to the array
    If session storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one
    If session storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function createStore and displayCart

Create a function getCartFromStorage:

    It should parse a string into a JSON object, returning the content of the cart stored in Session storage
    If there is no cart, it should return an empty object

Create a function addItemToCart:

    It accepts item(string) as argument
    It adds to the cart object the item
    If the same item is added multiple times, the cart store the quantity
    It stores the value of the cart object in a string for the key cart in the Session Storage
    It calls displayCart

Create a function removeItemfromCart:

    It accepts item(string) as argument
    It remove the entire item from the cart
    Store the value of the cart object in a string for the key cart in the Session Storage
    It calls displayCart

Create a function clearCart:

    It should clear the entire Session storage
    it calls displayCart

Create a function createStore:

    It should add a h2 tag with the text Available products:
    It should add a list with every item available for purchase
    When the user click on an item, it should add it to the cart

Create a function displayCart:

    It should add inside a h2 tag with the text Your cart:
    It should add an empty div tag
    If the div tag already exist, it should remove any list child
    It calls updateCart

Create a function updateCart:

    It should add a list to the div tag created previously
    If the cart is empty, it should add an item Your cart is empty
    If the cart is not empty, it should add the list of items within the cart with the following format: ITEM_NAME x QUANTITY (remove)
    When the user clicks on remove, it should call the function removeItemfromCart
    At the top of the cart, add an item named Clear my cart. When the user clicks on it, it should call the function clearCart

Tips:

    You can look at the GIF below to see how the interaction with the different elements works

Requirements:

    Build the DOM using Javascript only
    You must use the session storage of your browser and not a cookie or local storage
    Access your code with http://localhost:8080/7-index.html
    Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only
    src/index.js should stay empty - all your Javascript must be in your HTML, inside <script> tag

Repo:

    GitHub repository: alx_javascript
    Directory: Cookies_local_storage
    File: 7-index.html
